  p_r2: `Looking back, many think that the downfall of the pharaohs and the death of God were both positive developments. Maybe the collapse of humanism will also be beneficial. People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.`,

However, will this solution still work once rich and poor are separated not merely by wealth, but also by real biological gaps?`,
